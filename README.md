## A simple Vulkan application made by following [the Khronos tutorial](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/00_Introduction.html) with some artistic liberties 
The main goal of this project is to learn how Vulkan works and get more comfortable with modern C++. I tried to make the setup work on both Windows and macOS - it should be as simple as booting up VSCode and running the build with [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) and letting it figure out the kit. It requires the VulkanÂ® SDK (I used the [LunarG distro](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) for macOS support).
